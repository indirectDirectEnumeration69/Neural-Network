# Neural-Network


will soon integrate LSTM , RNN functionality within standard base neural network to conform to a hybrid architecture based on specific end goal of the model with additional work and training within matlabs based on language corpus datasets , testing efficency of updated models as i go for enhanced machine translation tasks and relational data mapping.



TODO : 
1. LSTM integration (bi-directional) 
2. diagrams of hybrid and base variants of AI language models above inital concepts.
